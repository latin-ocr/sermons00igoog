Again, precluus in the eyes os the Lord'is the
death os his saints: because, he deprivea death os ito
sting, and, encourages them in the moment of depar-
ture to commit therr spirits to his care, y and rely with ,
confidence on his ability to save to the uttermost all
those who hncerely believe in his mediation. They
are at all times his peculiar care: bnt, then, his al-

to support thern: and with that voice which called
all nature into existence, he bido them· notsear, sor ’

dual approach os the last inevitable honr. ’
