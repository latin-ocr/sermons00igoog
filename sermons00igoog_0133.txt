your admonition. Present ease und pleusure have
powersul chame, and is ‘God did not sometimes
put thorno into our beds, we would be in danger os
slteping out our time. But, when afflidlion comes,
it speaks convincin'gly, and it will be heard. Should
we then murmur ut alllislions which are sent sor so
kind a purpose? Surelp it becomes us rather to sub-
mit to them with cheer uluess, and improue thern for
the purposes sor which they were designed.

2. It ought to be observed, that, for the most part,
it is· the body only which suffers in csilidlion, unless
we, by our impatience, open a passage sor it‘into the
soul. And, surely, we need not grieve so deeply sor
the sufferings os that part os our nature, which iu
both the instrument and the iulet os all that fin which
brings our misery upon us. ln most os the diseuses

, rnouldering tabernaclo, be so precious in our fight?
lo it not our prison ? Should we grieve, because our
prison·walls are coming down'? The body, indeed,
is subservierit to the great interests of the soul; and,
in that point os view, must not be neglested. But, if
God seeo proper to clrastise it, ou account os its re·
bellion against himself, and our own souls; shall we
take the pert os the llelh, against our great Creator,
and provolre him to delivcr them both up to more
sererealllislion? ,

3. You should consider, that these very asilislious
that give you the greatest uneassncss, niay possibly be
sent by God, in answcr to your own pray'crs. And
surely, in this case, wc ought to receive them, noton-
ly with submission, bur gratitudo. Say, have you not

' osten made this your requell to God, that he would
lreep you from sin, that he might discover to you the
ranity os this world, aud all its enjoynrcnts; that he
would subdue your inward corruptions, aud take sull ’
possession os your beart? And is not afflictionis like.-
ly to be the means which God will employ to accom-

plillr these ends, ao any other? You wilh to belpegkm
