rer. η. on Imitating cora montumano. 265

raisrng the hearts os men to the highest pitch os virtue.
ortuis, the discourses os our Saviour, which stand
upon record, give us the most complete evidence.
His excellent sermon on the Mount, is particulari
asummary of pure religion, containing such perse
instructions, aa have raised the admiration'even os
his most implacable enemies. , ·

doctrine os Christ, to be still going on to perfectiori.

patience, even toward their worst and most malicioua·
enemier: ·“ Love' your enemies,” sayshe3 “ blesa·
