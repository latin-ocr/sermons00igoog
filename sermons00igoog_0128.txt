challisements os Godmust, at least, be received in
humblefilence‘. We have uo right ro murmur or
complain. lt is meet that we lay our hand upon
¹our mouth, and our mouth in the dull, is we cannot
open it to the glory os God3 as Aaron did, os whom
it is said, when his two sons were ssain by sue
from heaven, that he he'ld his peace.. This I eall the
least degree os resignation, because,
2. The beart, aa well as the mouth, must be silent
before G'od. It is os little importance to guard our
’ lips, if we secretly entertain disconteut in ourminda.

no less than our outward behaviour. Our very heanr
must consent to whatever is done by the great Father
os our spirits3 and no objeelion must be listened to
against the wisdom or righteousness os any othir

acquiesce init as good, because it is the will os Gpd.
, 'Of this acquiescence‚ we have an instance in Hezess l

trary master, but like that os a* child to a wise and l

'acquiesce in the dispensation, and receive it as a me·
dicine sor curing the inwavd distempers· of the soul· “

presses himself, «ι 1 know, Ο Lord, that thp‘ judgg
