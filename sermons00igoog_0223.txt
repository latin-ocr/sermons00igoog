lire. There are men, on the other hand, who, while
:y wilh to serve God, have yet a secret relerve for
τ gratification of some favourite lust. The'y are
nvineed of the propriety ol being religious, but thie
nvielion has an imperlefl influence on their con·
ἃ. Like Naaman the Syrian, they are willing to
yhomage to God, while, at the same time, they
›uld gladly indulge in any secret sin, to which they
ppen to be devoted: “ Thy servant‚'’ laid Naaman
Elilha, ‘⁶ will henceforth offer neither burm-offer·
ing nor sacrifice unto other gods, but uoto the
Lord. In this thing the Lord pardon thy ser·
vant, thnt when my master goeth into the house
of Rimmon to worlhip there, and he leaneth on .
my hand, and l bow myself in the house ol Rim-
mon: when l bow down mysell in the house of Rim-
mon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing (a).-”

of little importance, like a worm at the root of a
ant, will make them die, andwither at last. The
nuine love ol God, teaehes us to hate every evil and ·
‚eked work, to lay afide every weight, and the fin
rich moll eafily hesets us'3 and the person who dis-
vers indifference in one point, may be justly said to
indifferent to the glory olGod, and to offend in all.

rrist'a kingdom, and the salvation of othere. Gire
em but enough of this world3 let their corn· and

bether religionprosper or decline. They mind not
e afflifilions ol Joseph; they have no sympathy
ith those that suffer, nor do they mourn for the ark
·God when it is in danger. Like Gallio, or rather
'aworse temper; they care for none ofthose things ς
td, like those in the parable', go their ways, one to n
rfarm, and anotherto his merehandize. Inaword
