“ afflis'ted me.'' ,To suffer quietly, because we can·
not help it, is the resignation os a Heathen, but not·-
os a Christian. Resrgnation is founded on two things,⁴
a convisiion, that God is just when he 11111111 us,.
and a persuasron, thatthe afflietion which he sends, -
is intended for our benefit. Hence it follows,

4· Tlrat oursubmiffron will be aecornpanied w-ithz
love to God, anda disposition to praise him amidst
all our trials. ‚We are commanded to love out ene7·
mies, evenat the time when they are intending our'
hurt; and seeing tlr‘ey are only our fellny-creatum„
and, as such, , we. can have little or no dependance up· ·
on thern, how 'much more are we bound to love God,¹
who only appears to be our enemy, and cortesis us„
not sor his ovrn pleasure, but sor our prosrt, that so·
we may partake of his resemblance. lt was a noble
,resolution 01 David's, “ l'will bless the Lord at · all.
l‘ times: hispraise lhall coutinuallybe in mymouth(c).”'‘
A'nd we have a beautiful example 01 the sarne dispo*-
lition in'Job;,“ Naked,'⁷ says ho, „“ earne I out of ’
“ “- my mother's womb‚ and 'naked will I return: The
‘⁸ Lord gave, and the Lord taketh away, bleffed be: ·
“ the name of the Lord.''' , ’
