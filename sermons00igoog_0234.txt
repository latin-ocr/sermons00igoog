lead us into too extensive, though an important field
of discourfe, we shall confine ourselv'es to a few of η
those divine and heavenly virtues, which were the κ

1. ln imitation of Christ’s example, we ought to-
be inwardly pious and devout towards God. This
was a distinguishing part of our Saviour's charaslcr ·,
his mind wasgcontinually sixed upon‘ God, and he
maintaineda constant correspondente with his hea-
venly Father. Hence, we find him frequently lifting
up his foul in pious ejaculations, 3ηά always employ-
ing himself in some spiritual and divine exercite.
While others were engaged in thebufiness and 3-
musement of the day, or buriedin the silence or case
uf the night, he frequently retired from the world
to converse with his God, and sometimes spent whole
nights in that delightful emplo ment. ’ The most ex·
alted piety was exemplified in his life, and the most
ferventdevotion animated his behaviour3. devotion,
