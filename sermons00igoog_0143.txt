your wealrness, and turn your thoughts to somesub-
1061 111010 adopted to increase your satisfattion and

11111 surely its joys- and yours are 1101 effentially con-
001101. When the-body 11 decayed in the grave, the

then be present with your minds3 and especially let
·me persuade you to commit your parting souls to·

unali· now conclude witha few praelical direc-
110110.

’1. 11 10 necessary to seelr an interest in the friend-
ship of God, by a· cordial acceptante 01 the Ir'ord ·
Jesuo Christ,¹·the only Mediator between God and
man. Ibegin here, because, tillthis is done, all the ’
ather directions that l, 01 any man in che world, can
give, will prove useless. Wiclred men, through flu-
·pidit'y, may bear adrersrty witha seeming composure;
but 1 do not hesitare to affirm, that no man ean

impossible that 0111 minda can be formed to a rational
submissron 1ο the will of God, till once we are as-'
sured 01 his friendship ·,. till we are persuaded that 110
means to bring us to happiness at last3 and that 1111Ι
hia proceedings are calculated to promote this end.
Now, the principal thing being 111110 secured, having
sled to Christ for refuge 3-it will be of use,

a. To' keep your 0100 coustantly fixed upon God
himself and to consider every stroke 01 adverfrty as of
his appointment, whatever instrumenta are used to
bring it about. We are frequently in danger 01 1101-
1101 against our follow-creatores for evils that bel'al
uc. But when we consrder them only aa instrumente
111 the hand 01 God, we will say, as David did 10
his men, when they wanted him to ssay Shimei 101
curhng him, “ Let hirn alone, let him alone; 1110
