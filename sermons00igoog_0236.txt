212 Christ's'Exampsea perses? Standard Ser. 18.Ι Ι

. While we are in this world, we may lay our ae·
count to meet with afflictione. The danger, or the
adlual feeling of distress, are incident to human na·
ture. But there is one afflietion, the greatest of all
others; an afflidlion we create to onrsclves, and
which doubles every uncasrness; lmean, that liuh·

’ bornness of will, tha't impatience under suffering,
which is the offspring of pride, and the parent of mi·
sery. T his is that iron smew, which will not bow to
the will os its maheu this iethe· strong man within

“ with the potlherds of the earth3 but {hall the clap

confess that the judgments of the Lord ate right.
ln this manner, our Saviour himself acted while
he was in the world; and we who profess to bt
Christiane, ou hr to imitate his example. He trod
the rugged path of adverfitp with undauntedcourager
, he walked on in a course o suffering with the most
cheerful refignation3 and he did so, that he might

example that we might follow his steps. .
