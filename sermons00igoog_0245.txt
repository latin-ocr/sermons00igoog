Ser. 18. fsr· llic Imitatim cf Chrssians. 22!

when we profess robe the ‹lisciplcs os Christ, ancl, at
the same time, negleel ro imitate his example. Such
cond-nst is plainly inconsistent wirh itsels3 it is as-
onr Lord beautifully expresses ir, to haee a name ro
live while we are dead, or to profess to know Gorl,
when in works we rleny him. 'Are we not alhamerl,
then, to make such¹ an empty profession3 and ean wc
expe& either the approbarion os Goel, or th'e ressi-
mony of a goorl conscience? No; such a hope were.
varin. ls we juilisy ourselres, by pretenrling ro be
the rlisciples os Chrislz, while we 'are rsnlly llrangcre
ro his Spirir, nur own hearts will condemn u53 annl
is our heens condemn ue, Gorl ie· greater than
our herns, and will condemn ns nlso. Be not de·
ceired‚,rheresor'c; iris a eorrcr'pornling pracliee which
gives truth ancl dignity io yonr profesh0n3 without
worlrs, your sairh is dead, anri you yoorselies the·
children os the dcvil. , ’ ’ ,

y Consider, int-he last place, rhet, hy negleslirlg τοΙ ’

Of all the arguments that were ever' brought agirinst
religion, none. has made greater impression, than the·
irregular lives os its professore. This has inllisled
the ‹leepest wound, aml giren occasion to irs eriemies
to blaspheme that worthy Narnc hy which werne cnl-
led. An impioos and immoral professor os'Ch'rilli·
anity, is the greatest enemy to' the cross' os Christ..
He confitms the infidel in his unbelies3 he· hardens
the‘finner in wickcdnese3 ancl exposes- religion to
contempt. When they, who pretend to be the sol·
lowers os Christ, are urilihe their Mallem-:anch in.
stead os thar holiness sor which he was distinguished,
are unjust, intemperate, and ungodly ς, ψὴὰῐπιυῆ tlie'
world think? Will they not be read¹ to say, that
religion, and the petsect example olyJesus Christ,

are not-calculared, in their own nature, to ‘inlinence
