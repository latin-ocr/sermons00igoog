·Blesed Lord, who is she Amen, the faithful and true
Wimcss, charges them, in the verse immediately pre--
reding our text, w'ith this indifferent spirit: “ l
“ lnow thy worlcs,'' says he, “ that thou art neither
“ cold nor hot.” They had taken upon them the pro·-

Of Christ, aud the obligations resulting from thema„

ples were not lively and astive. They did not behav'e
tr those who are iu· carneli iu what they profess. ln

nd, os consequence, were destitute of that warmth
nd vigour, which charaslerise his disciples. In the¹
