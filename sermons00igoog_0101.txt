ln the days os David and the succeeding propheta,
we lind the Meffiah still more and more the desire os
the nations. Your time would fail me to mention
the various prooss os this important laet. The psalma
os David, in particular, abound in divine breathings
aster the expedled Saviour. And, with regard to the
{millillaelttslalillgllt:03‘lllllilll
“ os time, the Spirit os Christ which was in them
“did hgnisy‚ when it testihed beforehand the sus·
“ seringe of Christ,¹ and the glory that should fol-
“ low (a).’' And we have no reason to doubt, that,
during the period from the reign of David to the
appearance os Christ, the intelligent worshippers
among the Jews, served the Godos their fathers, in
hope os a Saviour t'o be afterwards revealed. .

When our Lord astually appeared in the llesh, there
was a vast expediation and defire of his' coming in the
erilh nation. This is abundantly evident from the
sung of Zacharias, the inspired rapture os aged si-
mron, the words os Anna, the question which the ·
Prirsls and Levites ut to John the Baptist, and from
rhe‘ conversation olP our Saviour with the woman of
Samaria. It even appears, that the coming os the
Meffiah was the common talk and wilh os that peo-
ple3 sor theca erness with which they followed any
person who alhmed the character, is a sufficient
propios thiscx celation. ι

Thus, frontale beginning os the world, to the
coming of the Messian, ‘through all the intervening
tinea of the patriarchs and prophets, and aster the
ceafing 'of the spirit os prophecy in the Jewilh church, ᾗ
Christ was the delire os that people and nation.

lt only remains tube added, under this particular,
that Christ hasbeen the proselled desire os all Chri·
lian natione, from his ascensron to the present times3
