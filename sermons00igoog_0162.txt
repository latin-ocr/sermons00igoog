ι. The soul, on its separation srom the body, re-
movestoanew place. lt passes stom the narrow
current os rime, and launches into the untrie'd and
boundless ocean os eternity. It leaves this unsubslan·
rial tabernaele os clay, together with this narrorv spot
os earth, and takes its slight into those vastly extend·
ed dominions, over which He presides, who has the
keysos hell and os death. lt removes srom this
earth, and enters into the upper or lower regions os
the vast invisible world3 sor, no sooner is the divid·v
ing stroke given by death, and the parting struggle
over, than, on the one hand, the souls os. the righte-
ous ascend into the mansione os ineffable light and
glory3 while, on the other hand, the soula os the
wicked, are driven away by evil anpels, as execution·
ers os the divine wrath, to that place os endless tor· '
ruent and misery prepared sor them, and there to
he reservedto the judgment os the great day. ,

within the limite os almighry power, ro establissr a
medium os communicarion between one intelligent
being and another, in every possible mode ol their
existence. Our conjeci ures ou this subjesi, must,'
sr'om the darkness which covers suturity, b'e vague
and uncertain 3 but our present manner os communi·
cation, the slow os reason through a material chan·
nel, is a proos os. tlte sadlr and, to unembodied spi-
rita, unacquainted with man, it would appear a {till
more doubtful point, and ¹they would be more ar a
loss to conjeblure, in what manner the grase sul>
stante os our bodies could 'be employed sor the· 'ur-
poses ol reasonable communication. 'she soul, theu,
when it takes ite¹ slight srom the body, must associate
