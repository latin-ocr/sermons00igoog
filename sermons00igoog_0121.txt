deisp. fflefulness of Chrss ilsrgllroted. 9}

“ Lord, and rejoice, γε right'eous. Let tbe children Ι
“ of Zion be joyfnl in' their king.’'.

11. But I now come, secondly, To mention, and

bricily illustrate, asew endearing charasiers of this ‚

mediatory fnlness which, it hath pleased the Pother,
should be in Christ. ’

1. It appears evident, from the observatione we
have already made, that this fulness is to be commu·
nicatecb to all those who sincerely believe in his name,
who aie the true membets os his church or mysticas
body. Hence, it is represented as an open sountaint
“ ln that day,'' says the prophet, “ there shall bea
‘¹ fountain opened to the house os David, and to the
“ inhabitants of* Jerusalem (a) ;'' that is, to all sin-
oete believers, without exception, who, as the spiri·
tual seed os Christ, are of the' house os David, and,
aa living meoibers of the choreb, are inhabitants of
Jerusalem. Nay, we are not only allowed, but kind·
l invited to come to it for pardoning mercy, for life,
iirength, and consolation. “ Ho, every one,'' says
εἷς, “ that thirsteth, come to the waters3 and pe that³
ει ἓίἷᾙῃῗζῗὶζὲι slssrllsssslf-,illlhl‘llt
‘⁸ day,” says the evangelist, “. the great day os the
“ seali„Jesus stood and cried, If any man thirsi, let “
“ him come to me and drinlr (b).’'· ·

2. lt is an abundant and inexhaustible fulness.
This is the fulncss, os which all the saints, that ever
lived, both under the Old and New Testament dis·¹
pensations, have been receiving, and of which all the
redeemed and· glorified around the throne os God
shall r'e'ceive to eternity. lt is so connested with the
ipfinite perfecimus, and everlalling strength of Al·

miglny God, that it llows with an undiminiihed and
uncealing stream of happiness and comfort to all
those who are purified by the blood of Christ.
l'rom the influences that flow from this fulness,
their happiness is eren every moment increasesl.x This,
