for the openly profane cannot impose upon any but
such as have no mind to he religious: Wherea8‚ hy-
pocriteS, under a speeious outward appearance, con·
ceal the deformiry oi viee, insinuate themselves into
the affefflons, and by good words and 'fair speeehes

deceive the hearts ο the fimple. ΙΙ do not indeed
‚deny, that a profane person gives a more pernicious
example to the world, and may do more mischief by
such an example3 but the hypocrite sometimes does
more prejudice to religion, by undermining it, than Ι
the profane person by all his open affaults. Τ he 1
former, is an open and declared enemy, and therefore
has ir less in his power to bring calumny and reproach 1
either on religion itself, oron those who have devoted
·themselves to the observance of its precepts: But the ·
latter, is a concealed enemy, he killos when he would l
betray, and makes it almost irn offible formose who ¹
have received no imprellio'ns ni seriousnele on their ¹
own minds, to determine concerning the efferes oi 7
religion on the minds of others. And, finally, it ir-
much easrer to guard against such as are 'o enly pro· Ι
iane and licentiou's, than against perions'olpthis 'che-
radier3 because we are ready to esteem them fin'cere ·
and upright in their profeffron. ·

4. The hypocrite is a charadler which God will most .
certainly punilh with great severity. For, arhecan· ,
not be deceived by the most artful appearances, end
as he has a perse& knowledge oi the hearts ot‘ all men,
he will not fail, in dne time, to make the hypocrite
appear in. his proper colours. This -is what om·
Saviour expressly tells us in the verse immediately .
following the text3 “ There is nothing” says he,

‘¹ covered that {hall not be revealed‚ neither hid that
, “ [hall not be known.'' 'she day is approaching
when he will take off the mall: with which hypocriten·
are now covered, the mall: of all their counterieit·
ed piety, when she will expose them, with all their

deformities- about them, irrthe open light of dpyp ι
