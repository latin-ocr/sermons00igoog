The eridenees of his resurree'tiom we mentioned

, and illustrated in the former discouis .

' From the 44th verse, we have our Saviour's dis-
course to his disciplcs‚ before his ascenfion ς in which, .
he explains to them, from‘the prophecies of the Old
Testament, the neeeffity ol his own death aud resur-
nilion. Like an affetlionate parent, who is to leave
his children 'on the world, he gives thern suitable in·
struehions concerning the defigit of their miffion, and
the dodlrine they were to puhliss13 and comforta ⁸
thern with theprornise of the Spirir‚ to supply the¹
wants of his horlily presence, to'qualify them for
their important work, and„enable ¹them to deliret·v
their mellage with credit and success. ln this man-
ner, as this evangeltll expresses it, “ ile lhowed him--
‘¹ sels alive to thern after his pallion, by many in.
“ fallible proofs3 being seen of thcm forty days, and'
“speaking of the things pertainiug to the kingdom
“ of God a .'' ’

One g‘reait ibjeet of our Saviour's nrission was, to ’
nean the affeehionsof men from the things of thiu

’ world, and to fix their attention on rthe happiness oi

afuture and eternal state, which he died to p.. sure.
Our Saviour, during his whole ministry‚ in· propor-
tion aethe prejudices of his disciples could bear ir,
was instrudling thern in the spiritual nature uillis
kingdom. But the period-was now arrived, in which·
their miride would receive the most complete con·
vietion of this important faci. Hia submillion ro
death, hia resurreeiion from the grave, and his e·-
scenfion into heaven, were a cornbina'tion of cir·
cumstances, plainly calculated to show them, that
his kingdom wau not of thiu world; and that, .
whithei he was going, there, in duc time, they ,
would be also. To this evidence, during the fortv
days he continued on earth, he added particular in‘f
liruelions concerning the things that pertain to the
kingdom of God. And when the time of his being·
