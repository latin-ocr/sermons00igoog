immoveable, always abounding in the work os the
Lord3 sorasmnch as we know that our labour os love·-

shall not be in vain in the Lord.

Iam now to dire& your attention to a praslical
improvement os this subjevst· ’

What reason have we to admire the love os¹ Christ
to ¹his people, asir is compared ro the Father's love·
to him? lt is a proos ⁴of ignorance and westness, ’
to admire those-things which are common and mean,
but it is rto less an evidence os stupidity, ,not to be
affected with things that are noble and exalted. Now,-
the love os Christ to his people, is the greatest, the·
most unexanrpled love, that ever was; an instance of
affection, indeed, so noble and ex'alted, that, *in eon«
templating, we. carinae but admito-it. Nay, the·
=inore we employ our thoughts on rhis'love, the more*¹
astonishing it will appear. Is it not asubjett sor eter‘
nal admiration, that the Son '‘os God, the brightness·
os his Father's glory, the express image os his per-
son, should love any of Adam’s guilty and rebellione·
tace, as· his heavenly Father loved him l· Justly may:
we adopt the apostle's words to express our admira·-
tion3 “ Ο· the height, and depth, and breadth, andr
‘⁶ lengthos the love of Christ! it palleth ltnow·
“ ledge.'' In proportion as we esteem a favour, our·
affefflon should be exerted towards the person who
procured it.. Now, in consequence os Christ’s love,
we are preserved from every thing we would mostra
anxioussy ssiun, and¹ we receive every thing we molh· Ι
sondly hope lor. We ate restored to the favour oss
God, we receive the forgiveness os oursrns3 we en-
¹joy the riches os hisgrace, the alhstanceos his Spirit,
and the prospe& os happiness which shall never end.-
¹Are not those blcslings calculated to preserve in our
guinds, geonstant andprevailingdefire to continue irr'

ialove.
