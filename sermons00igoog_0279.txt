His graees, like flowers in the winter, may disappear,
and hide their beautiful heads· The spirit os lise re-
mains in him like the root in the earth; but he a·
bounds notin the display and exercise os the Chris*
tian greces. And when this ia the case, you may
plainly perceive‚ that the Christian cannot be said to
abound in the work of the Lord3 nay, sp far sroni
it, that, under those decays os grace, he ‘wissl lament
his own condition, and utter that paffionate wissr o't‘
the apollle Paul, when he was in similar circumstan-
ces: “ 0, wretched man that 1 am, who shall deliret
“ me srom the body of this death ?”
