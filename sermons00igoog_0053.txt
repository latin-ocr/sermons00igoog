Christ ssronld continue to be 'the vvisible Captain o'f
our salvation on earth, but we have reason to rejoice
in the words of consolation which he administered to
his disciples, when they were afflidled with the pro-
·fpedl bf his departure, “ hs my Father's house,”
“ are marry mauhous3 if lt were not so, Iwould
.“ have told you: ·l go to prepare a place for you
“ pafl- How -infinicely, then, are we indebted to
Jc us Christ! What endcaring obligations ly up·
ou us to love and honour him, who not only purcha-
fed heaven for us by his death, but who has gone be-
fore to prepare it for our reception!

Lrssly. He ascended, that he might·secure to his
·followers their admilhon into heaven after him. ht
the mean tirne, having all power in heaven and in
carth committed to him, he reigns above as the guar.
dian of their title to an ‚incorruptible inhesitance.

Hence, the Christiau’s future afcensron into heaven,
'is as certain as that of his Lord and Master. He will

It now remains that l diret'i your attention to some
fuitable improvement of this subjedl.

1. If Christ our Lord and Saviour be ascended into
heaven, it becomes us to follow ‚him frequently thi.
ther with our ahoughts and meditatibus. Let our
minda be diredled to the contemplation of what he is
in himself, of what he has done and suffered for us,
an'd of what he is flill doing, now that he is paffed in-
to the liparensand far exalted above ‚every name.
