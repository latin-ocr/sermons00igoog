the deceitsulness and corruption os out own hearte.
We have therefore the greatest reason 'to fbe always
on our guard, and to exeat the firmest resolution· and
fortitude, in ordertltat we may be enabled 'tonith-
stand in the' evil day, land be stedsast in the work o's
the Lord. ln a word, we must deliberately resolve
to be for God and our duty3 and, whatever be the ·
consequentes, apply ourselves with vigour to our Chri·
stian work. Of this, we have a remarkable instance
in the condud‘t of the apostle Paul, an instance highly “
worthyos our imitation. When the Spirit os pro-

pheey¹ had soretold, that he sstould be bound-at Jeru-

salem, and delivered into the hands os the Gentiles,

his friends would have dissuaded him stom going αρ’

to that city, but, with agenerous and undaunted spi.

rit, he replied, “ What mean ye to break mine heare?

‘⁶ sor Ι am ready, not to be bound only, but also to

“ die at Jerusalem, for the name os the Lord Jesus.''

This, indeed, wasa Christian hero ς, he would not

quit his post, nor make lhipwreck os saith and tt

good conscience, notwithstanding the <langere to

which lte was exposed ι “ None os these thinga,'' says

he, ‘⁸ moves me ,neither count l my lise dear to me,

“sol may sutilh my course with joy.''

23 Being stedsast and immoveable itt the work of
the Lord, implies in it constancy‚ or an unisorm sted-
diness in adhering rothe saith os Christ.

This. constaney is opposed to fickleness and in.
equility in 'the discharge os teligious duties. It is a '
virtue, os which no human being can in this lise be
perscelly possessed. Experienee, and the word of God,
unite 'in ‘informing uo, that obedience, w' ' eny
mixture os sm, is impradiicable τ’ “ Theffljffi ·
“ man upon the earth,” says Solomon agebat do'th
“ good, and srnneth not.'’-“ lf we ffiss' says the
apostle John, “ that we have no frume deceive our. ·
“ selves‚ and the truth ‘is not in ue! · In many things
tte all offend3 and is any has the³vanity to pretend to .
