this manner, the awakened stnner will naturally ex· ⁵
presa his concern. He is amaneu, and blushea to
list up his face to God, because os his iniquities⁸
Like the publican, who stood asar off, and duest not
so much as list up his eyes to heaven, full of inward
concern he smites upon his breast. In avvord, the
soul in this condition, is covered with darkness as
