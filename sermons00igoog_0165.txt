Eternity lies before you, and you are hastening for--
warde. What exemption do you claim from the do·
minion of the grave, and the stroke of the king of
terrers? What is your opinion of an eternal world ?
We surely ate uot laying before you things doubtful.
in their illue, or uncertrin in their operation. Since
the creation of the world, vanity is written on the
pride of man3 and his strength, and glory‚ and beaw·
ty, have'bten laid in the dull.

Let us therefore frequently and fetioussy meditate
on death. Without being all our lifetime' subjefl to:
herlage, feeing we have a sure foundation of hope,
let every ordinary occurrenee‚ every revolution of ’
stason, and‘ every· change of circumstance, bring to·
our mind, that, in a [hort time, we mustput off this
tabernaele of the body, and lay it down in the grave.-
When we lie down to lleep, let us meditate on sseep··
ar the image of death, and remember‚ that, in a few·
days,we must sseep ina bed of dust.. When we·¹
awalre, perhaps this may be the last morning· we·
lhallenjoy before that ofthe resurreetion. Thus, even*
the most common and ordinary altioris of our lives-
ma‘y be improvedto remindus of¹ death 3 nay, almost:
every thing around us, and every condition of life in·
which¹ we are placed, lhould lead usto the: fame:
