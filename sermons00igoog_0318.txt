¹ nonebut God himself can accomplillr. To sorni re·
ligion in the heart, is to raise a dead srnner to lise, to
make light arise in theumidll os darkness, and to re·
duce the greatest consnsron to harmony and order: ard
what can be sufficient· for thio, but the¹ singerosGod?
God alone is the author os n'ature3 he at first com-
manded the light to shinc out os darkness, 3ηά sorm-
ed every part os this visiblc world. His goodness
¹ and mercy ate the source and sountain os every bles· ·

provementwe make in knowledge and wilcium, are sole·
ly derived srom him. Now, is his influence necessary

more depertd upon him sor things os greater conset

Almighty power to cr'eate a world3 nay, to produce '

it not require an equal degree os power to tranrsom -
the human mind, and to quicken it when dead iu .

¹ what powersul oppofitiorr is raised against this work,
by our spiritual enemies. No sooner does the soul

os adversaries. Satan, the prince os darkness, whose
power is still very great, exerts himself with the ut·
most vigour‚ to prevent thr salvation os¹ finners. He
¹is a malicious and an adlive enemy3 who employs
every art, and watches every opportunity, to render
