224 On Pcrserurance in the Leve osChrss. Set. 19.

‘³ every branch that beareth sruit, he purgeth it, that
‘¹ it may bring forth more sruit(‹u).” And, because
att our sruitsulness dependo upon our, union with
Christ, as the fruitsulness of the branclues dependo
upon their union with tlte vinc, he exhorts his disci·
ples, in the beginning os the 4th verse, to continue
or abide in him, by the constant exercise os saith and
love, that he might be engaged to abide in them by

,the influences os his Spirit: “ Abide in me,’' says
he, “ as I in you.'’ This exhortation he enforces itt

¹ this and the two following verses, by representing to
them, the absolute necessit os their abiding in itu,

’ in ordcr to their fruitsulness, the 'extreme danger os
apollasy, or not ablding in him, namely, that os fi·
nal rejeslion, and being call into the lire, as u fruit--
less branch takenfrom the vine, and, lallly, tlte
great benefit and advantage they, on the· other hand,

. would reap, b'y their abiding in him, viz. the full au·
swer os their prayers. In the gerse immediately pre·
ceding the text, he recommends to them abounding

¹ fruitsulness, as that which would redound to his hea-
venly Fatber's honour, and be amanisesl proof, both

'to themselves and others, that they were his disciplet: ,
“ Hereby,’' says he, “is my Father glorilied, that
“ ye bear much fruit, so shall yc 'be my disciples.'’
And then follow the words of the text, expressive os
the love of Christ to his disciples, and ensorcing,
from the best motivo, the continuance of their at·

·tachment and regard: “ As the Fath'er harh loved
‘⁴ me, so haue I loved you: continue ye in my love.”

In these words, you may observe an important du·
ty recommended to us, “ Continue ye in my love.’‘⁴

. This may be understood, either os Christ's love to·

hi's people, or of their love to him ς or, rather, both

maypehincluded,sor‘phey are inseparably connected.
