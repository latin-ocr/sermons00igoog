5. It must be constant and persevering: “ 1 have
⁴‘ inclined my heart,” 'says the Psalmist, “to perform
'“l thy statutes alway, even nnto the end.’' No man
can be said to keep God'o commandmen'ta, who only
seems to attend to hie duty at certain timeo and sea·
sons, and at other times negleeb ἰτ.Ι Some. lor in·
stanee, put on the appearance or {how of bein reli·
gious about the time of a sacrament, on the Sihbatl
day, and on other public and solemn occaliona; but,
at other times, they throw off the malle, and indulge
themselves in forbidden liberties. ln a word, there
are many profeshng Christiane, who serve God at
intervals only. Terrilied, perhaps, by some alarm·
ing Providence, or roused by an owakening ser·
mon, they set about ¹reading and praying‚ and other
, dutiea which they had formerly negledied: but, ina
little time, their devotion cools again 3 their goodnesa
becomes like the morning cloud, and like the early·
dew, which soon poss away. Nay, too often they¹
return with the dog to his vomit, an'd with the soie
· that was wollino, to her wallowing in vthe mire. But,
be not deceived 3 this is not ιο keep the comandnients
of God3 nor are those the marks of his children.
Evangelical obedience is a much more settled and.
constant thing. It may poffihly admit of some breaks
and interruptions3 hut it is what the Christian hahi-
tually aims at, and what will hevenbe quite laid
, alide. For, as the Spirit of God informs ua, ⁴⁸ the
⁴¹ tighteons lhall hold on hiswny, and he that hath
'¹‘ clean hands lhall he llronger and stronger(a).”
