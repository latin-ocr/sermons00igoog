Ser. 24· os Divina In ramice. 297

ι. The manner os the Spirir's operation is secret and
mysterious. lt is difficolt, is not impolhblc, sully to
explain it. We cannot, in many enses distinguilh be· ,
tween the motione os the Spirit, and thoseol our own
minds, between the immediate suggestions os the Holy
Ghost, anrl the ‹lifiates os our own reason. For this
reason, our Sariour uses a ligure os speech cxprelhve os
indeterminate and incomprehensible operation: “ The
“ wind‚’' says he, “ blowethwhere it lilleth, and thou
“ hearcst the found thereos, but canll not rell whence
“ it comerh‚ and whirher ir· goeth: so is every'one
“ that is born os the Spirit.’' But we must not there-
fore deny the reality of this operation. We must not
deny that ‚Gon adis powersully upon the* mind, be·
cause werre unable sully to comprehend the manner
of his operation. Are there not many things in the
world which we know to be certain fadis, and which
no man in his senses will pretend ro dispute‚ os which
however we cannot give any tolerable account? Are
wenni all os us senhble that our souls are united to'
our bodies? Do we not feel the mutual influence
which theyhave on each other? and yet, Which os us
can pretend to say in.what this union consrsts? We
are affured, both rom reason and revelation, that God
works through all in rhe natural world, that his pre-
sence supports and animares the whole creation 3 and
yet we are strangers· to the manner os his agency3 -
or, in the language' os Solomon, “ As we know not
“ the way os the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow
“ in the wornb os her that is with child3 even so we
“ know not the works os God who nraketh all.''

2. The manner os this operation, is likewise various
and different. God is not confined to one unisorm
method in dispenfing his grace3 he is an infinitely v
'wise and free agent, who has perse& knowledge of
'the heart of man, and divides to every one severally
as he wills. lt‘lany'intleed, and various, arethe means
he is pleaserl to employ. Sometimes he awakens the ’,

conscience with awsul conrielions os goilt ς [οηιειίωζε
