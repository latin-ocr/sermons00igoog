sent! Happy were it, if, under this consideration,
you received the word which we preach, as the 'ihes-
falmiam did, not as the word of man, but as the
word of God. For then it would work effedlually in·
you, as ir did in them. But, alas! our apprehenlionr

There your souls first met with christ, there your

much comfortable communion. What reason, then,
