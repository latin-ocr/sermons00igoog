1. There is no time not period, no condition not
circumstances of life, in which we ought to neglefl '
it. The charms of prosperity sttould not feduce tu,

nor the powers of adverfrty deter us, from abouuding
in the work of the Lord. When we are in health,

,’ we shouldapply to it with vigour; when in hcknefd,

it ought to be our chief concern· In the days of
youth, we fhould bring fo’tth our summer fruits; iu
mure advouced age, solid piety and religion 3 and in
old age, whenthe body is 'hastening to the rate, the
foul lhould hd²pfucing in affeftiorrs on‘thethings
which are above. .- Wherever we are, whether iu the
'house‘or in the lr'elds, inethe closet or iu company,
Religion should, of all things, be the nearest to out
heare, and'e'mploy our most diligent care. In the
night scalon} when lleep does not close our eyes, the
meditatiori of God should be fwcet to ¹us3 when we
awulre in the morning, we sstould be still with him,
and io the fear of the Lotd all the day lung. ln a
word, no danger fhould prevent us from ohfewing‚
no consideration prevail with usto neglect, this im·
portant duty. We must prefer it to our chiefell
worldlyjoys, andro all the delights of the fontof

mcn3 fot we are to feel< ‘fust they kingdom of Gddd
