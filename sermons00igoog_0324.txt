6. The Holy Spirit likewise sets the mind at liber·
ty srom the prevailing inlluence os lust andrieious in·
clinatione. Evil pullione formerly reigned in rhe
beart, the will was disali'edied to God and religion,
while it was strongly attached to fin. Hence, reason
had not its proper influeuce; the best instrudliona
were altogether irreffeelu213 and the motions os the
Spirit were stifled irrthe soul. This deplorable state
is emplratically represented'in scripture, under the
image os a llony heart, aud a carnal mind. “ The
‘¹ carnal niintl,'' says the apostle, “ is eninity against
“ God 3¹ it is not subjedi to the law 'os God, neirher
“ indeed can be.’' But n0w‚· Alinighty grace inter·
posrng, this eumity of the heart is suhdued, andrie
will 'disarmed os its prejudice aud oppofitiou. 'llius
the mountains melt like wax at the presence os th'e
Lotd, who tur'ns the hard rock into a standing water,
and the flinty rock into a springing well.

7. God, by his powersul renewing grace, givesa
new direslion to the will, and renders it obedient to
the will os God. Having thus delivered the soul from
the bondage os corruption, he restores it to the glo·
rious liberty os the children ns God; he excites in
the mind those holy dispofi'tion's, and implants those
divine qualities by which it is inwardly renewed and
disposed to walk with God. This is exprefl'edin
scripture, by giving nien a new heart, and puttinga
new spiritwithin them 3 the accomplilhinent of which,
God claims aa his own prerogative. Formerly,the
spirit met with the lreenest oppofition in the soul; all
his strivings with it were ineffedluah and the finner
remained inflexibly wicked. But now, a mighty arm
is revealed, the sceprre os hia kingdom, and rod os
his strength. All obstrudlions are removed; every
high imaginationis brought down; and sinnerc are
tnade a willing people in the day os his power.

Bur further, God not only worke in his people to
will, but likewise to dn, by affording them all neces·
