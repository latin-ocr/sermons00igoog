3. Christ will be the desire 01 the natione 101110
ehd 01 the world. The importanee of the gospel to
mankind, together with the promises in sacred scrip-
11110, are proofs 01 110 continuante and increase. We·
look sor happier times, when the bleffed Redeemer
shall be more the desire 01 the nations than he has yet

, been. “The kingdom 01 heaven is like a grain of
l ‘⁶ mustard seed, which a man took and sowed ina
j “ field3 which, indeed,¹ is the least 01 all seed83 but,
' “ when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs,
“ and beeoineth a tree: so that the birds 01 1110 air
“‘conte and lodge in the branehea thereos.'' We ·
