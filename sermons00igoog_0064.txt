a‘Spirit, in spirit and in truth. To l'east on 'such a
laetifice, must therefore be a delightful and -refressr-
ing entertainment to the soul ol the believer. “ He,''
lays our Saviour, “ that cateth my fleth, and drink-
“ eth my blood, hath eternal life, and lwill raise
“ him up at the last day; lor my flelh is meat in-
“ deed, and my blood is drink indeed-.” But, fur·
ther, it is likewile a least upon a sacrifice-3 as, in it,
believers‚ who are made priests unto ¹God for that
end, offer up the spiritual, sacrifices of prayer and
¹praise‚ and other edla of devotion; being affured‚
‚that they lhall be accepted in the Beloved. Nay,
they are, as the apostle exhorts -them, to'offer up
themselvesa living sacrifice, holy-and acceptable to
·God, which is their reasonable resvice (d). And this
-leads me to obferre, ,

on a sacrifice, so they frequently covenantedtoge·
-ther at seasts. We meet witha remarkable instance
of this in Gen. xxxl.‚· where Jacob and Laban rati·
-fied 'their covenant ol lrieirdlhip, not :only by offer»
ing sacrifice, but by leastiug together: and-undet the
-New, Testament, the apolllevspeoks of the communi-
on of the body and blood of Christ, aa correspond-
ing to the 'eating ol -the sacrifice. Upon seatiirgour-
lelves at the, table ol the Lord, and partalcing of the
sacred symbols, we ‹loclare our acceptance ol the
gospelcovenant, that 'we take the Lord for our God,
and devote ourselves to hia service: and, certainly,
. *the obligations which we <then corne under, excel
‘every-other tie, ns much as the sacrifice of Christ
excelsthe sacri-lices ol elreyews3 or the spiritual eat·
ing and drinkingof his body and blood, the portal·-
ing of the ancient sacrifices at the altar. -In a word,
by our eating and'drinlcing at the table ol the Lord,
we take a solemn oath, that we will betrr'e and faith-
'ful to him; and il we are sincere in this covenant·
engagement, hegracioullypromiles, ¹that he will be
