‘³ will sup with him, and he with me.'' ln a word,
the gospei·covenant ‘excindes none thatdo not ex-
clude themselves, by having no desire or inclination
to partake os the blessings promised in it. ·

'tions those must be possessed os, whom Christ will
make welcome to these rIch and precious bleffings.

spiritual bleflings. But seeing God is pleased, in
condescension ro our weak capacities, to represent the
defiree of the sous, by the sensatione or appetites os
