in aword, is that pure river of the waters of 1110,
'proceeding out 01 the throne 01 God arrd 01 the

whom ir dwells, is‘thc same Almighry Redeemer to·
day, yesterday‚ and 100ον00. 01 this sulness, he
can neither be deprived bv the powers 01 earth-nor
hell: ‘⁴ I give ro my sheep,’' says he, ‘¹ eternul lise;

“ and theyihall never peritii, neither shall arry pluck
“ them out of my hand.'¹ At his death, indeed, the
powers 01 darkness endezivoured, by every exertior
01 malice and strength, to prevent him 10000 poffes·
fing it; but he triumphed over them in his 00010, and
he 11111 triumphs over thern in the grace which he
communicares to his servants. Let not the Christian,
thembe afraid, as 11 any thing could hinder the eom·
