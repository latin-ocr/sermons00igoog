stratur, nor does it depend oa the seebl
apostate heart ς’ buris establissted by the '
an Almighty Redeemer, in whose light, t
as well as their life, i's precious. χ
This leads me to the second general head - 02, ns· '

course, which was to shew in what respedls their
death is precioua in his fight.

Il. It was sm that brought death into the world ς and
which, though eventually a blellrng to the saints,
is a formidable soe, from which human nature shrinks
with averhon„ This psalm, therefore, celebrates the
goodness os God in delivering srom death 3 and con-
tains a prayer, that the lise which he hadso gracioos-
ly preserved, might sor the future be spent in his ser·
vice. This remarkablepreservation os the psalmist'e
lise, was the reason os the obsewation in the text,
that ‘⁸ precioue in the sight os the Lord is the death
“ os his saints.'’ '0 · ·'

Their death is precious in his fight, in that he ir
pleased osten to bless them with length of days, and
to bring them to the grave in a good old age, as 'a
shoclr os corn eomes in his season. The sons os vio·
lence and strife frequently rise up against the-saints of
God. But, their lise and all that is dear to them, are
depofited in his hands aa a sacred trust ς he forsaketh
them not in any case, and in his sight their lise as well
aa their death is precioua.·· He redeema their soula
stom deceit and violence, and.will not permit their
blood wantonly to be lhede nor will he bring them
to the grave, till death, to them, become great gain.

. Old age is in a peculiar manner promised to tbe
saints. ‘⁶ 'l'hey shall inherit the earth, while the
“ wick'e'd‚ who are in great power, and spread them.
“ selves like a green bay trec, shall be cut down lite
ξ( the grase, and pass always-‘f The Lord kngyredth
