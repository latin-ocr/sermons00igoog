hppiy to him as the discipies did, when they thought
themselves in danger 01 smking, “ Lord, saveus, ot

earnestness 3ηά importunity suitable to your danger. Ι
luaword, when at any time you are attached by

Thus I have endeavoured to thew you the danger
10 which you are exposed by the temptations 01 Sa·'
ian, and in what manner you areto resrst aud with·

hand them, viz. byputting on the whole armour 01 ’

God. “ Starid therefore,'’ as good soldiers of Jesus ·
Christ, “ having your loins 'girt about with truth ς’
'‘ and having on the breast-plate 01 righteousuess,
¹‘ and your feet mod with the preparation 01 the gos·
⁵‘ pel of peace. Above 311, take the {hield 01 faith,
¹⁴ wherewith ye ssrall be able to quench all the fiery

“ the word of God z Praying always with 311 prayer

‘⁸ unto with 311 perseverante.'' ,

And hnuw, for your encouragement, that if you ’
thu stand against the wiles 01 the deril, and hold out
t0 the ⁸end of your Christian warsare, God will at
¹²st bruise Satan under our feet, and bring you off
more than conquerors through Him that loved you:
