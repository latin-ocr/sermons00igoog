170 ⁸· TheilncrficeofChrss Ser-15

Some interpreters think, that, hy the four liviny
creatores, and the four and twenty elders, are mean
the heavenly world, the brightest and most excelleo
of created hringo, and the glorified spirits of just mer
made perfeci, who are as the angele, and join witl
them in their exalted worship. But ¹the general, ant
indeed most probable opinion, is, that by these ex·
yr'reffions, we are to understand the whole church · ol
the redeelned, both ministers and people, in¹ the day's
ol the gospe13 so that, we ourselves are a few of· that
happ number, if we ate indeed of those thet wor-
rhip llod in the spirit, and rejo'rce in Christ Jesus.
By the four living erectores, then, we may under·¹
stand, the holy, enlightened, and faithful ministers of
Christ, the pastore and reachers hc has given to the
church. And hy the four and twenty eldere'the
whole bod of private -Christians, and devout'wot·
{hippers ol God, through the one Mediator, in all
the affcmblies ol the saints. ln the fourth xverse ol
the preceding chapter, they are said to be roundr·
bont the throne ς sorio are all that worlhip God in
spirit and in truth. They are clothed in white, which
isemblematical of theinpu'rity¹ and holiness. Aul
they have crowns on their heads, sor they are hein
of the kingdom, ¹and are to reign with Christ„

This, then, is an easy and familiar explanation of
the four living creatores, and· twenty four eldett·
’ They are all, asin the foregoing verset, the redeem·
ed to God, out of every hindred‚ and tongumnl
,people, and nation‚ and arc made to him hings and
priests. In the text, they are said to be· an innunc't
rable‘multiturlet ten thousand 'times ten thousand,
and thousands of thousands3 and there is the voice
of many angele joining with them, saying‚ ‘¹ Wonhy
“ is the Lamb that was ssain, to receive ower, and
“ richen, and wildom, and strengthond 'hennon and
¹ f‘ glory, and blessing.” . ’
