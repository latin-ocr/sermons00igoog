went up into heaven. Thio, indeed, ia hinted at in
the two following verses of the same chapter: “ And
“ while they loolredstedfa'stly toward heaven, as he
“ wen't up, behold two men,'’ that -is, angela in the

“ heaven.” Hence the 'manner of bia ascensron was
honourable and glorious. He returned to heaven aa
a triumphant conqueror, having-obtained ¹the most
signal vidlouy over all his own enemies, and those of
his people. He made the cloud his¹ charior, and an·

with what joyfolacclamations would he be welcomed,

Lastly, We may attend to the place whither he a·
scended 3-He was carried up to heaven. The apostles
law him ascend gradually from the earth, till a cloud
received him out of their srght3 and two angele
came and told them he was gone into heaven. Heia
elsewhere said to have ascended up far above all hea-
vens(dl; meaning, 1 suppose, that ¹part os the heavena,
which is at present visibleto the inhabitants of thir
