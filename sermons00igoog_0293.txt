Ser. 22. On Imitaring God's Mora! Perfidiam. 269

“ can we do? deeper thau hell, what can we know ?
‘³ the measure thereos is longer than the earth, and·-
“ broader than the sea.'' '

We ought therefore to conceive os God, as posses·- J
sed os every poshhle persedion. And this in some· ·
irrstances has'been diehaeed by nature herself. Hence
the w'rsest among the Heatherrs represent him as the¹
rr'rost excellent, arrd perfeeh3 the greatest, and the best
os Bei'ngs. And the sacred scriptum, ¹those pu're and ,
uncorrupeed fountains ostrum, every where ascribe .
persedhiontoGod. lothere, he is representedas a·
Spirit3 sels-existent ;Δ independerrt3 filling i'm'mensrty
with his presen‘ce3 srom everlasting to everlasting3.⁴ '
the same to day, yesterday‚ arrd for ever 3 so wise, that
he kno'ws the heartsos men 3 so powersul,- that to him
all things are poffib1e3 so perseehlyholy, that the hea- .
vens are not clean in ¹his fight3 so J ust and'righteous,.
that there'is no iniquity with him3 so true and saith-
sul, that. is he has said it, he wjll ,certainly ¹do it, if
he has spoken it, he will make it good3 and so abun,-
drnt in mercy, that,frather than we should perish, he,
sent his only begotten Son to be the propitiation sor
our sms. In eword, the most exalted created intelli·
gence can firhply adore the greatness os God; himseh's
alone can comprehend it. · Ι

In thi's. manner, then,¹ we are to eonceir're os¹ God,
as infinitely removed from *every kind -and degree o's'
imperfectionffnd,as-pioffeffedofv the highest degree os
excellence. ·
