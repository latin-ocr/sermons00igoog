let. 19. οη Perseverance in ibe-Love of Chrys. αἱ,

³⁸ for a moment, hut· with everlasting lrindness will
⁸ 1 have mercy on thee, saith the Lord, thy Redeem·
'‘ er· For the mountasns shall depart, and the hillt
'‘ be removed; but my'hindness fhnll not depart from
⁸ thee, nor the covenant os my peace be removed,
‘ saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.” Hence,
[esur loves his peo le with an everlafling tove; a
ove that hae made the most ample provisron for their
mmortal souls3 and in the happy fruito of which,
pte redeemed os the Lord will rejoice and triumph
or ever. ’

tt Inow proeeed tu explain the duty in the text, or
hev you what it is to continue in the love of Christ:
'‘ Aa the Fnther,'' says he, “ hath loved me, fo
¹⁵ have 1 loved you: 'Continue ye in my love.'’

ι. It ir to continue in the lively and vigorous ex·
ercife of love to Christ. lt is indeed true, that the
habit and rinciple of love, when formed in the soul,
tan never he wholly eradicated; for it is a' divine seed, ⁸
which the Almighty hand of the Spirit has planted,
and therefore it will never die away or be rooted up:
“ Whosoever ie born of God,” says the apostle John,
‘⁸ doth not commit s1n3 for his seed remaineth in
‘⁸ him (m).” But, at the same time, let every fincere
lover of Christ remember, . that though this divine
principle can never be wholly extinguished, it may
yet languifh and decay. The Christian, like the
thurch os Ephesus, may falt- from his first love3 and
therefore, wc should take particular care to cherilh
and maintain this heavenly seed, this divine spark
¹ts love kindled in the soul. In a word, we should
*runt against whatever may have a tendency to cuol,
naban our love to Christ; and endeavour, by fre*
quent meditation and prayer, to preserve alive the
ttgorovt' exercise of it in our soulr.
