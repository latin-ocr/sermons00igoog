will consili not only in a complete deliveranee from-
ever thing that i‘s troublesome and uneasy‚ bnt in·
the ihil polseffion of the greatest good of which their·
nature is capable. ι .

And this* is what is chiefly meantby eternallife in
the texty fot that can mean nothing less than lise in
'ns greatest perfeetion We then truly-live, when we
draw our first breath inat-he air os heaven; when we.

venlyilate. Thatjndeed is· the true birth-dayes a·
saint: so that this expreslron denotes the affluenee os
all that can render our state completely¹ happy.

1 might here observe to you, that the bodies of the·
saints at the resurreetion will be made more perse&
than they were in this world. Our present earthly
bodies are perpetually tendrng to corruption; and,
how 'admirable soever ‚their strudlure may be, they are
at best but bouses of clay, whose foundation is in tbe
dull. But then, they shall be raised incorruptible and
glorious bodies, and be purified to that degree, as to
partake os the immortality of the soul. ‘⁴ The dead,'’
the apostle tells us, ,“ shall be raised incorruptible;
“ sor this corruptible must put on incorruption, and
“ this mortal most put on immortality·;” and then
shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,
“, Death is swallowed up in vidlory(i).” ,

T be happiness of this bleffed state, however, will
chiefly confist in tbe perse& and he'avenly life ‘of the
soul; sor, then, all its powers will be enlarged,. and y
ito delites satisfied. ⁴ ’

The· understanding will be enlightened with new
discoveries oi ,nseful and noble truths; with amore
