But, let us adore the richer, aud the sovereignty os
Divine grace. In his way thither, Jesus, the injured
Redeemer, appears, aud diffusos round him a bright-
ness excecding that of the sun, 'on perceiving which,
Saul fell prostrate to the ground, and heard a voice
srorn heaven calling to him, “ Saul, Saul, Why per-
“ secutest thou me ?’' The furious persecutoris now, “
indeed, melted aud s uhdued3 he who, butalittle be'-
