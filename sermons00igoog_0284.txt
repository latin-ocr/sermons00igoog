rou 'will nothe able to abound in the work of dre
- hord? Hear his gracious promise, iu which he ex*
postulates⁴ the matter with the ssorhful Christian, aud
effellually answers the objeelion of want of strength:
“ Why ,sayst rhou,'' says he, “ 0 Jacob, and speal·

“thou not known, lrast thou not heard, that the
‘f Everlallirrg God, rhe Lord, the Creator of the ends
“ of rhe earth, sainteth not, neither is weary?
“ There is no searchingoof his understandinp lle

Fear not, then : his grace will be made sufficient lor
¹you3 lor his strength is made perse& in wealrness.
- Lostly, It ia the work of the Lord: You lhould

And this brings me ‘to the second argument or mo·
rive in the text, viz. the bleffed recompence ol re·
‚ward that is here promised3 ‘⁴ ·Forasrnueh as γε
‚“ know, that your labour ionot in vain insthe Lord·'¹

Labour, without a suitable recompenee, is not eafily
enduled. He, who is compelled to undergo such la-
bour, will alway's find it deprell'rng and ongratelul.
But he who devores himself ro the service ol God¹
will find that his labours have not· been iu vain.
During the time in which he was engaged in them,
he enjoyed a peace which the wielred ¹do rrot know,
and which the world cannot give. Nor is this the
onlyladvantage whieh he reaps from hie work. By
¹rhatwork, he is gradually prepared lor immortaliry
and heaven3 and his foul is lilled with transport, from
the· wfll-grounded hope, that he flrall one ¹day be
