314 On the Nerqffity and Marmer Serty. 1

vinced os it, we need only look into our own herrts, l
or take 3 slight review os out pall lives. 11333 we not ,⁴
311, stom our earliest years, frunt the very 1311 open-
ittgs os reason, a violent avetstun to every thing spi·
rituully good, and as strong 3 propenfity to solly and
vice? Have we not indulged this stnsul bias 131333-
merahle instantes? Have we not omitted those du·

‘ ties which God expressly requires, and committed ¹

those sins which he ns plainly forbids? And 33311 ,
not such a condudhbe ‹lispleastng to him? Yert as
