3. The soul, at death, enters on new employ-
ment os its attive powers. In the present state, our·
inquiries are chiefly diredled to material objedlS.
We contemplate the perfedtions os God in the worku
ns his hand, in the efforts os infinitewisdom, and in
the'amazing produdhions ,of almighty power. But.
we see in part, and we know only in part. We are,
aa it were, confined in a dungeon, where, from a
small opening, we behold the beauties os nature.
Our situation in this world, 'fixes us down to local
and sellish considerations. Our point of reasoning is-
lo narrow, that we ean come *to very ⁴few general
conclufions. The operatione os nature and provi-
dence are partly exposed to our view ς but the amaa·
ing sources os love and consolation, the general plane-
υἱ w'isdom and gradual perfedlion, lie beyond our ob·
servation. However keen we are to pry into afuture
llate, in whatever anxious manner we endeavour to·
look forward, there isa vail os impenetrable obscu-
rity which interrupta the prospedt'. This vail· is re·-

no sooner leave the body, than they are delightfully '
employed in the incessant praises of God and os· the
Lamb, andin whatever unknown exercises may'be
affigned thern, agreeable to their nature, and os
the rnosl noble and exalted kind. But, how different*
the employment of the unsanetified soul, when dis-⁶
lodged srom the body! For, then, it relledls, with un·
wailing grief, and, incefl'ant sels-condemnationen ito:—
