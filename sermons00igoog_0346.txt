their life is without God in the world3 it is alienated
srom the lile os God, and destitute os real comfort.
And therefore, though naturally alive, they arc saidto
be dead, deadin srn, and even to abide in death.

And there is great reason why an unconverted slate
should be represented hy the metaphor of death; sor
there is nothing.in nature that more fitly represents
it. As in adead body no vital motione appear 3· so
in an unrenewed foul, there ate no motione os divine
lise; no breathings after God, and spiritual enjoy·¹ “
ments; no zeal ‚sor his glory‚ or devotion to his inter·
est. As a dead body is devoid os all sense and seel-
ing; so is the soul os an unconverted linner: insen-
sible to its misery and danger, it seels not the woundr
which sin has given it, it trembles not at the wrathos
Gon with which it is threatened, and, though sland·
ing on the very brink os eternal ruin‚ will use no
means to avoid it. And aa a dead body 'ts a ghastly
end undefirable objedb which cannot be velwed with
any degree os plcasure; so an unconvetted finirer,
especially a profligate and licentioris one, is a sposla·
cle most loathsome and abominable, in the eyes os a
purcand holy God. Upon these, and. many other
accounts, an unregenerate state is fitly represented to
uo under the notion os death.

In a word, we may say with propriety os 'every un·
converted srnner, aa the apostle does of the person
who lives in ianre pleasnres, “that he is dead
l‘ while he lives, dead in sin, and ignorant os the
valuahle purposes sor which he received existence.

2. He is virtually under a sentence of eternal death.
As we commonly say os a criminal condemned to die,
thar he is a dead man3 so itnny well be said os an ·
. impenitcnt linner, that he is dead 3 dead in the eye os
the. law, as being condemned hy its just sentence.
Thur it uras with Adam, when hyhis first transgres-
lion lreincurred that dreadsul curse3 “ ,ln the day
ξ( thou eatest thereos, thou ¹shalt surely die.’' 'l‘lnyn
