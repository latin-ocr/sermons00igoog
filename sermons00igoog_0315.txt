torlimportant doElrirre, the agency and alhstance of
the Holy Spirit afforded 'to good rnen undet the Chri-

three things remarkable.

1. The Blelsed agent employed in this work. It ie
God, or the Spirit of God, the 'thiro Person of the
sacred Trinity, who was sent ,by Christ tos bear the
part which he sustains in thescheme of nran’s re-
demption, and to 'purfue the ⁴glorious dehgn on
which the Saviour came into the world, in appl ing
the henefite of his death and purchase to the souis of
his peop1e3 for, what God is said to do, in the work
Of our sanctification, he does by his Holy Spirit. ’

led egent. 'He worlts inhis people both to will and
l⁰ do; that is, he inclines thern to that which is,
8⁰0st and‘well-pleasrng to God, and enables them to
do it. He works in them those holy dispositione,
those divine qualities by which they are inwardly re·-

lorcls them all'necefiity aide for performing the vari--
