applause in his heart; and if he pretend to rhun, or·
‘fly from it, itis only ,that you may reckon him to de·
serve it rh< more. Νη, [οηιςτὶωεε, by a refined*
. 'stroke in deecit, the hypocrite will speak with herita-
rion of his own merit and afflonr13 but, if you con-⁸
tradi& him not, he is greatly disappointed‚ and dis-r
covers manifest indications of uneafiness: a plain proof„
that. his censores against himself are only so many'
haits ‘to catch the praises of others. But, if you go
forther, and tell him of his faulto, you vviH not hilvv
to kindle his resentment3 and though, for· the sake

of his own reputation, he may conceal it ‘for a rimor
yet he secretly indulges intentions of. revenge, ond,v
'only waits for a favourable opportunity of gratifying¹
that malignam paffion on the man who· had2presumae-
ed to offend him by his counsels. In a word, what·
, ever religiousv duty the hypocrite-perforans, his secreta
boast is that of the Pharisee: “‘God‚· 1 thank theo.
. “ that 1 am not av other men are3’? or, like ⁴those vivom.

the prophet Isaiah speaks of, he says, “ stand by,
’ “ corne not near me, for 1 am holier than .thou(a).”‘

ι And this brings me to obferve to γοα,

ς. That the hypocrite is very partiar: to hrmfeffl ·
andmakes- great allowances for his· own hohor ,
⁴ while he is severe in censuiing tho chamoemnd v
condustof his-neighbour. Thus-‚ive find rherevere '

amore in their brother'oe e,¹ but took· nov notice 0f
›the beam in their own.⁴ 'hese our Lord severely-re· ²
proves, “Thou hypocrite,'' says he, “ first c'a'strhe
“ beam out of thine own eye, and'then (haltthoo ¹
‘.‘ see clearly to cast out the more out of-rhy brother’s
“oye (q).’' This rhen you find is a distinguissriog
mark of the hypocrite: He observes the condo& of
othersoith a jeolous eye3 not that he may imirrtc
’ whatisgood, or avoid what is evil, but merely. tv ἶ
