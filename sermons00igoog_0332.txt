deepesl dislress and anguilh os mind, he is ready to
adopt the-langnage os Joh 3 “ Oh, that my grief were
“ thoroughly weighed, and rny calamity laid in the 1
“ balances together l· For the arrows os the Almigh·
“ ty are within me, the poison whereos drinheth up
‘⁸ my spirits: the terrors os God do set themselves in

sul, than to be exposed to the wrath os thehlmighty,
who cnn punish to the utmoll, and who lives sor ever ,
to execute his rengeance? How vigoroussy then ζ

our inquiries sor deliverance natural. The finner, a·
wakened by a sense os danger, seeing himself guilty
· and pollnted‚ is filled with anxious concern ς and the
language os his heart is, “ What shall 1 do to bc
