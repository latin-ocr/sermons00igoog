saith, we view the methodos our salvation throug
Jesus Christ3 that wonderful dispensation os divine
grace to sinners, in which mercy and truth a're met
together, righteousness and peace have embraced each
other. It is here the Christian has the sweetcst and
most intimate access to God3 he approachesunder
the shelter os a divine Mediator, and lists up his eyes,
