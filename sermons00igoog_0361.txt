' We iive roo much in the neglesi os 'this hearenly
exercise, arrd this perhaps is one reason that 'we enjoy
solittle of heaven upon earth. . Did we praise Goe
more, he would gire· ns greater cause to praise hini.¹
But os ‘this we seidom think. 'We are anxious to'so-
iicit relies ¹when-we a're in dangerous 'o'r distressful eir-
:nmstancesz but how ssowly do we return to give glo-
ry th God! luet me 'therefore i'n‘treat you, in all your
addreffeo to the throne os grace, to give praise and
:hanka their due proportion. In days of humiliation',
or ‘in some special case of (lisinis, our sins and oot'
dhnger mayhowe the greatershare3 but inordinarycases,
as much of our rime ought to be empioyed in humble
rnd thankiril adoraiion of the Divine 'greatness and
goodne'se, as in eonfeffion os our fine, οῖ begging ·
those supplies which our wants require. That excel·
ient model os denotion which ‘Christ has lest to his
chorch, lays ι solid foundation sor thia remark· It
both begins and ends with⁴ adoration3 and the three
peritioris which are first ¹in order, direffly relate to
the adcancement os God'a glory. We are taught to
pray· that hir name may be hailowed3 his kingdom
come3 and hia will be done on earth,¹ as it is in hea-
ναις before we ,beg any thing sor ourselves 'in parti·
cuiar· · ·
ἑ If we desrre to experie'nce theDivine presence, and
see the giory os God in the sanhhuary, let us apply
ourseivee to this high and heavenly work. The oe..
casron of our present meering. gives us a sair invita-
tion to it.. The great objeci which this day presente
to us, is the hamb of God, that takerh away the sm
of the world, In the sacrament, we are to behold
Christ evidently set forth as crucifred before our eyes.
nnn can we refrain from 'adoration and praise, whilst
we contemplate Him, who is the brightness os the Fa. ¹.
andi glory‚ and the express irn'age of his person?
should we not rejoice and give thanis, while we are
called to commemorate the ,anspeakabre gift of Gor!
