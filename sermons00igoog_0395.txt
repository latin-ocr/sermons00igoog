glories of the place, the' society of angels 11111111-
rsaints, the serenity of their own pure and ima
culate soulsr but, above all, the enjoyment ο1 their
rious God and gracious Redeemer. For, ,aa they
vw that they love him, and feel this love to bethe·
rmest affedtion of their hearts 3 so, they know that
also love'o them. Nay3 every moment they taste
his love, and live upon it vaith inconceiveable de·
at. And, O, what· an unknown satisfastion must
[e in the mind from the full affurance of the iove
God ! what tongue can express, what heart con·
ve, the sacred pleasuve that filla every foul in hea-
1, under the immediate and lively sensatione of thio
vine love! is communion with God on earth¹ so
puisrtely deiightful, that a graciouo soul would· no't' 1
:hange one minute of it for all the mostluxuriour
asures of the sono of men? Is it 1ο delightfui, at.¹
ohumble distance, to taste of the stream? How
:onceiveable then must be thehappiness of dwellingj
the fountain head, and drinking of those rivers of
usuro, that flow at God's right hand for evermore!
Another thing that will render the life of the righ-
·ue in heaven unspeakably happy, is, their exercise
d employment. ·In the scriptures, they are repre·
vted, as testing not day nor night3 aa praifing and
ging Hailelujahs to Him that srttethupon the
rone, and to the Lamb; saying, “ Worthy art
thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and
power, for 'thou hast created all things, and for·
thy pleasure' they are and were created: To
Him 'that loved us, and- wassred us from our fins
in his own blood, and hath made us kings and
priests unto God and his Father3 to Him· be
glory and dominion, for ever and ever.'’ ,Their
ercisc, in a word, is one continued triumph over
r and Satan, anda constant celebration of the-praises
redeetning love: And, O,.what harmonious me·
ky will thir make, when every soul is filled with ,
re, and every tongue resounds the praises oiKtheip
