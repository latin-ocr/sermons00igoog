Ι. We are to describe the nature os that approach
to God, which is a fruit os the divine choice and sa·
voun, ·

When we are said to approach to God, ¹our apa
proach cannot respect his effential presence, which ia
equally alilre in all places. God is necessarily near to

- all his creatores, he is intimately present with every
one os us; sor in him, as the apostle expresses it, we
live and move, and have our being. Inthiasense,
therefore, we cannot be said to draw near to God, aa
we are always in-his presence, and ¹cannot withdraw
stom hiaSpirit. -But the expression, approachin to
God, plainly respecta his gracious presence, which ie
discovered in the bleihngs and benefits it bestows on
mankind. In some sense, indeed, the gracious pre-
sence of God, as well ae his essential presence, ia
common to 2113 “ sor hc makes his sun to rise on the
“ evil and on the· ood, and sendeth rain on the just
