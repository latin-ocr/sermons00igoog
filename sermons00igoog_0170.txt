1· Andthe first I shall mention, is God'e gracloot ,
presence with them in all their distresses. And, what ·
a reviving consolation is this! Th'e presence os God·
with his people, dispels all the clouds os afflidkion rod ι·

’ sorrow, as the sun scatters the fogo os the morning;
it eompoler the mind, and fills it with considente

,and joy. ln what a high strain does David speal os
it, in the 23d Psalm! “ Thoughl walk,’'- says he, 1
“ through the dark'valley and lhadow os deathl
“ will sear no evil, sor thou art with me.’' Sone- ·
times, indeed, the children os G'od make onwarrant·
able reflectione on ›the‘ distreffes with which they rte
visited. They are tempted to say, as Gideon did,
⁸‘ Is God be with ut, why doth all this evil be'sal
“ us ?’' But it is not because the Lord hath sorsaken
them, that he deols with them in this mannen it it '

' for the chastisement os their offences: and, when he
does so, he asle the part os a father ‚and a stiend
“ Whom 'the Lord loveth,'' ¹says the apostle, ‘¹ he .
“ chasteneth, and scourgeth eyery son whom he re· '
‘⁶ ceiveth. ‘lsye endure chastening‚ God dealeth with

sar from being a mark os God's sorsaking his people,
that he is never more gracioussy present with thern,
than when they are afflieted. Thus, he was with
Daniel in the lion’s den; thus also with Shadtach.

present with his children, when 'they ¹are under the,
rod. He not only, as a wise and loving parent, cor·
rests them sor their saults 3 · but he mortifico their re·
