ourGod. For such we find to‘be the tenor ofthe
corenam: “ Iwill be their God, and they lhall be
‘-‘ my people(e).”‘ And, as 1 formerly observed, ·
this catenant is unalterably confirmed, by the {hed-

· diug ο1 Christ’a blood3 1ο that every believer may
now triumph in the reasoningof the apostle,-He that
spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
all, and who gives us his broken body and {hed blood
to feast upon, how lhall he not with him also lrecly
give us all things? ,

4. lt is allo a feast of love. The 'Jewilh pallover,
which was an eminent type of it, war a least ol love
ae well as of remembrance; for it was celebrated by'
the whole nation of the Jews, allembled together in
one place, plainly intirnating, that they were one
body united together in love. But the Lord’s Supper
ie much more a least'of love 3 soritis a memorial of
the unexampled and allonilhing love, which the Son
of God erpreffed in laying down his life for us;
and surely, on our parts, 'it ought to be kept with
the warmest gratitude and affedlion. Our' hea'rts
lhould burn with· love to him, who loved us, and
wassrcd us from our fins in his own blood. But be·
hdea‘ this, it is also a least ο1 love, as it is most fig·
nificant of that Christian charity and love which the
guests lbould bear to one another ς for they all ht at
one table, and eat of the same brcad, and drinlr' of
the same pup. Nay‚ by this solemn atrion, they de-
clare their love to each other, as children of the same
divine famil , andmembers ο1 one m stical body, of
which ,chriti is the Hea'd ς and thereibre they ought
to be united to ether in the tenderest bond ol sym-
pathy and affetiion. Happy are they who abound in
tlhic grace. The God of love and peace {hall be with . '
tue? And, lassly, It is a plentiful feast,''and freel ’
given, the provihon ο1 a God, who deli lits to ,exercid
leving-kindncss in the earth, and ,vili supply all the

wante of his prople, acpprding ro his richer in glorgs
