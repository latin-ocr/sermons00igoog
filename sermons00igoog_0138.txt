tro · Rgfignntion to {sod Ser. 9.

a. Let us attend to the reptoaeh of the world.
This trial is, doubtless‚ a severe one; and yet,
¹ even here, there is no reason to murmur or com-
plain. Is the reproaches which we meet with are
just, we ought to lament the occasion, and amend
our ,condudl sor the future. But suppose the censure
altogether without foundation, may it nothe permit-

t'ed sor wise purposes? And 1 am apt *to elieve,
- that salse aspersione, however vexatious in the mean
time to those who labour under thern, are yet ca·
pable os many excellent-improvements. Thur, a man
who sets too high a value on the opinion and ap·
plnuse os his ¹sellow-crentures, and who is ready to
endeavour to attain it3by indirett methodo, may by
this means have his eyes opened, to see the impro-
priety os a violent regard sor tlreesteem os the world.
It will show the necessity also os approving ourselves
to Cori, the Witness and only infallihle Judge es the
eharallers os men. The opinions os mankind are sel·
riom right, and always liable to -abuse3 nor are the
friendships os the world extremely constant. The ap-
pearanceof a storm may soonbanishour general sriendsj
'r'o'r sew have resolution to support a charaner which
the general voice condemns: but the* unchangeable
God never varies in his y'udgment. ¹Whorn he justi·
stennone can eonrlemn3 and whom he loves, he
loves unto the end. Belides, bearing the reproaeh
os men, may serve to render the Redeemer more
¹ precious in our esteem. And surely we ought never
to complain ol* any thing thntmay be improved to ·
this purpose. Does reproach, does calumny, fit heavy
on your mind? How much then do you owe to
Christ, who, sor your sake, became· os 'no reputa,-
' tion, and endured the contradidlionos sinners! He
was accusedos drunkenness, os lu'ttony, ‚and many
, other viees3 and et, in spite osan, perfisted in hie
graeious delign ossavi'ng alost and ruined world.
W h'at an admirableoppor'tunity then are they favour· Ι
ed with, of increasmg in love and gratitude to ’their
