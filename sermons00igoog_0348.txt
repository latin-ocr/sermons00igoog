nt least unprositahle: noy, they are said to be treeetvict
dead, piucked up by the roots. The light os the gos·
pel ssiines round about them, the heavenly dewdt·
'scends upon them in a greater or less quantit„ but
all to no purpose, unless, by their own sinsus ahuse, to
render them more and more unfruitful. Thus they
are lost to the service os God, to thetgood os others,
and to the asasety and happiness os their own souis.
And what then can they in reason expedi, but to have
that dreadsul sentence pronounced upon them? “ cat

‘⁸ up to his own heart’s lust‚” he wanders in· his own
counseis, and is every moment in dan er of plunging
into endless misery. Like a benighted traveller,
whose way is near pits and suares, and who has no
able guide to dire& him3 every step he takes is at the
peril os his lise. Nay‚ he runstvith satal precipitancy
in the way marked out sor him by Satan, or by hio¹

nation and wrath‚ tribulation and anguish, sivall bt
the everlasting portion os every soul that doth evil.

sore his conversion. He is destitute os spiritual lise,
and bound over by his guilt to eternas death. He it
lost to the service os God his rightsul'owner, and e·'

tery moment in danger os perishing sor ever. u
