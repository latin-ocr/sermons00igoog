Serss ti pf Chri s Refitrredlion. ς

‘and understood it os the temple at Jerusalem, the
evangelist insonus us,· that he spolie of the temple of
hisbod . ·

Thesh predidtions of our Saviour suggest several
observatione, which tend to confirm his resurredlion.
He not only informs thern that hc was to rise on the

, third day3 but, at the very same time, he informs them

l that he was to be put to death in a public manner.

ζ The truth os this part os the prophecy, as depending

ἓ on tlte mallee of his enemies, could uot be counter·
feited; and the sulstlmeut of this gives eredit to the

Saviour, the circumstance most worthyos observa-

their condudt would haue been represented in a diffe-
