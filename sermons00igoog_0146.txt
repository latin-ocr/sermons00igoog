our meditations on this solemn and awful subjed
should be improved. -

It is to affist you in such reflee'tions, that I have·cho
sen this passage of scripture 3 “ Man dieth, and wusteti
“ away3 yea, man giveth up the ghost, and when

“ is he ?'' ι
From the beginning of this chapter, io the 7th

verse, Job gives us a lively and affeeting view of the
ihortness o life, and the miseries that replenish it.
In the Jth, 8th‚ and 9th verses, he compares 'the
death of a man to the cutting down of n rree3 and
fhews that the latter, in some respeehn has the ad·
vantnge of the former. “ For there is hope of ᾳ trec,
“ is it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and
“that the render brunch thereos witi not cens .
“ T hough the root thereof wax old in rhe earth,
“ and the stoek thereos die· in the ground: yet,
“ through the scenr of water, it will bud, and bring
‘⁴ furth boughs like a plant. ‘But man dieth‚ and
‘⁶ wasteth away, yea, rnan giveth up the ghoff, and
⁸⁸ where is he ?’', The rational foul, whene'ver it re·
tites from the body, is too great, too noble a thing,
to be recalled hy any of the powers of Nature, thr
sun or the rain cannot affe& τις Ιττοτ c'an i't be resto?-
ed to the body, except hythe immediate operatione
od the Almighty. Man dieth, und man giveth up
the ghost. ‘the first word transsated Man, [ignifieu
in the original langunge, a great and mighty man}
the second, signifirs a poor οτ mean man3 plainly inss
tirnnting, that death makes no distinction that it en·
ters into the palntes of the great, us well as the cot·
tagesof the poor. The tnighty cannot resdt its sorce3
the treasnren of the rich cannot bribe irsx delay 3 there
is no discharge in that war, neither ssrall wickednctr
deliver those that are given to it. ·

“Man dieth.” This is a general accountof that great
chan e we must all undergo. 'rhe expreffion ir awtd
